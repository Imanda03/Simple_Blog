Authentication Service
Posts Service
Comments Service
Client (React Frontend)
API Gateway
Nginx Ingress Controller

Prerequisites

Docker
Kubernetes (Minikube/Docker Desktop)
Skaffold
Node.js (v16+)
npm
kubectl

Local Development Setup

# Linux
curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/latest/skaffold-linux-amd64
sudo install skaffold /usr/local/bin/
3. Local Kubernetes Setup
